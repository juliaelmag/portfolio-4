        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; max-width:900px; margin:20px auto 0 auto;">In Making 1 I coded a website about who I am using a given template. This assignment was completely foreign to me. Although, simple I was very proud of my ability to navigate the code and curate my website to reflect who I am. I figured out how to add photos to my folder and then assign them a place on my website through the code.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; max-width:900px; margin:20px auto 0 auto;">In Making 2 I was really inspired to create some sort of "game." I decided that tennis would be the game. Admittedly, a lot of this website was programmed by AI but I did understand how some of the coding was made. I used Ai to create the code and I "copy-pasted certain" sections of the code into specifec areas in my code. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; max-width:900px; margin:20px auto 0 auto;">For Making 3 I wanted to make another website about me but from my own coding. I learned from my last website that I wouldn't get very far if I kept on depending on AI to do the code for me because I wouldn't ever understand what the AI was coding for me. For this multipage website I was very proud with my own coding and ability to work through my obstacles by being a "pro hacker." I successfully made a website all about my favorite things with working buttons to take the user to information slides. I went into the code and I made my website, for things like the size of pictures, I was unsure how to change that. I asked CoPilot to help me edit the size of one picture and once it did that I learned from that code and was able to then change the size of my other photos. I think that this was my biggest learning experince out of the 3 "Making" projects.</p>

      <!-- 1, 2, 3 side by side -->
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left">In Making 1, I learned how to use code to build a website that represented who I am. Even though I started with a given template, I learned to adjust the HTML and CSS to fit my vision. I figured out how to add my own photos and assign them spots on my page, which made the site more personal. This process showed me that coding is a creative tool, not just a set of strict rules. Each time I tested changes and saw them work, I gained confidence to experiment and trust my ideas.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 1, I worked with classmates to troubleshoot problems and share ideas. For example, during Making 2, I created a tennis-themed game with some help from peers who shared tips about JavaScript organization. In return, I explained parts of my HTML setup to others. Talking through these challenges helped me understand coding concepts better. The workshop setting made the learning process feel collaborative instead of stressful.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3. Think deeply about craft.</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left">By Making 3, I realized how small details shape how a website works and feels. In that project, I wrote most of the code myself without relying on AI. I paid attention to things like button placement, image size, and navigation flow. When one image was too large, I used CoPilot to figure out how to adjust it and then applied that knowledge to the rest of my site. This taught me that thoughtful, precise coding makes a big difference in user experience.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development.</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left">Across all three projects, I had to research how specific tags and commands worked. In Making 1, I looked up how to insert photos. In Making 2, I learned how to embed interactivity into a game structure. By Making 3, I was solving problems independently by reading documentation and experimenting with my code. This steady practice showed me that progress in coding comes from patience and consistent effort.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
        <p style="text-align: left">Sharing my projects helped me see my work from others’ perspectives. In class, I explained how each website functioned and what I learned from building it. For Making 3, I presented how I coded buttons and structured multiple pages, focusing on clarity instead of technical jargon. Presenting my sites this way built my confidence and helped me communicate my ideas in a simple, clear way.</p>

        <p>Making 4 was my first introduction to Adobe Premiere Pro. After I watched a few tutorials and figured out the basics, putting together my image essay was quite simple. After that all I had to do was add the text and that was also pretty simple. I really enjoyed this project.

        <p>After Making 4 Premiere Pro was much easier to navigate and putting together the videos in this project was rather simple. Overall, I also really enjoyed making this project (Making 5).

    </a>
       <p>For Making 6 the idea of this project wasn’t too bad in my head. However, figuring out some of these text animations took some peer help. After some explanation though, it was rather easy and simple to put together.

        <p>Making 8 took me quite a bit of time before I gave up. I don’t know why this was so confusing for me to figure out but making this little character talk using my face tracking was rather hard. After I gave up, I again had help from a peer that explained to me how to get it working and then I was able to do it myself. I really enjoyed my little soccerball character that mimicked my every move.

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 2/3, I learned how important experimentation and creative risk-taking are to my process. In Making 4, my first project in Premiere Pro, I had to figure things out through tutorials and trial and error, which pushed me to approach my work with curiosity rather than fear of making mistakes. As I moved into Making 5 and began building a full video essay, I found myself thinking more flexibly about storytelling, how visuals, timing, and sound come together to shape meaning. Even in Making 8, when I struggled with Adobe Character Creator, the creative habit of sitting with confusion and trying different approaches helped me eventually bring my soccer-ball character to life. Phase 2/3 encouraged me to trust my creative instincts, explore unfamiliar tools, and stay open to the unexpected.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Collaboration and peer support played a major role in my progress during Phase 2/3. In Making 6, where I had to create special text effects, I relied on classmates to help me understand the more complex animation steps. Their explanations made the tool feel less intimidating and showed me how valuable it is to ask questions early. Similarly, when I was struggling with Making 8, another peer explained how the face-tracking features actually worked, which completely changed my ability to complete the project. These experiences taught me that the workshop environment is not just a place to receive feedback, but a space to share problems, compare techniques, and grow through community.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Each project in Phase 2/3 required me to think more intentionally about the craft behind digital storytelling. In Making 4, I wasn’t just putting text on images, I was learning how pacing, composition, and visual flow can reinforce the emotions I’m trying to convey. Making 5 pushed this even further, because editing video demanded careful attention to rhythm, clarity, and how each shot connected to the next. By the time I reached Making 7 and began working in After Effects, I started thinking about the craft of animation itself: how movement, timing, and precision contribute to an effective design. These projects helped me shift from simply “using the software” to understanding the artistic decisions behind every frame.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Phase 2/3 required me to continuously build on prior knowledge, and each project became a form of long-term skills development. From Making 4 to Making 5, I saw how returning to Premiere Pro with new expectations pushed me to refine what I had already learned. In Making 6 and Making 7, I expanded into more advanced text animations and motion graphics, which meant researching tutorials, exploring new tools, and applying feedback repeatedly. Making 8 tested my persistence the most, I had to research solutions, revisit instructions, and attempt multiple versions before the final character worked. This phase showed me that new media skills don’t develop instantly; they accumulate through sustained practice, problem-solving, and revisiting techniques over time.
</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 2/3, I learned how to communicate my creative choices more clearly, both visually and through reflection. Making 4 helped me understand how pairing images with text can create a narrative that feels cohesive and intentional. By Making 5, I was presenting a more complex piece, which taught me how important it is to make my editing choices understandable to an audience through visuals alone. Projects like Making 6 and Making 7 required me not only to create polished effects and animations, but also to think about how viewers would interpret them. Even Making 8, with its expressive character, reminded me that presentation is about clarity, personality, and making sure the audience understands the purpose behind my design. Altogether, this phase strengthened my confidence in showcasing my work and articulating what I learned.</p>

        <p>After 4 weeks of research I decided that I wanted the focus of my presentation to be on one singular athlete, Mohamed Salah. My presentation focused on how Salah has had a major impact on the decrease of Islamaphobic sentiment across football fans in England.  </p>

        <p>I wanted my kiosk to be an exploration of not only Mohamed Salahs career but his identity as a Middle-Eastern and Muslim. To understand why Salahs "effect" is so importatnt, grasping who he is as a man is very importatnt and I wanted to share both of these things through pages that explain his "Early Life," "Career," "Activism," and "The 'Salah Effect.'"</p>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 4, I strengthened my creative thinking by turning my research into both a polished multimedia presentation and a fully interactive kiosk centered on Mohamed Salah. Building these two connected pieces required me to experiment with layout designs, image treatments, multilingual features, and accessibility tools so that users could understand Salah’s story in a clear and meaningful way. Working on both the presentation and the kiosk helped me push past simple design choices and think more creatively about how to communicate complex ideas.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">During this phase, I used feedback from peers and class workshops to improve both my presentation slides and the functionality of my kiosk. Sharing drafts of my storyboard, layouts, and button designs helped me understand how others interacted with my work and what needed to be clarified or reorganized. These conversations directly shaped how the kiosk pages were structured and how the presentation flowed, which made the final versions clearer, more accessible, and more engaging.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Phase 4 encouraged me to think carefully about craftsmanship as I developed my presentation and kiosk. I made intentional stylistic choices, such as the warm color palette, the consistent visual identity between the slides and kiosk screens, and the placement of Salah’s imagery to support the emotional tone of the content. Paying attention to spacing, readability, navigation clarity, and visual hierarchy allowed me to create a cohesive experience that connects the multimedia presentation with the interactive kiosk in a visually strong and meaningful way.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both my presentation and kiosk were built from weeks of research on Mohamed Salah, including his life, career, activism, and the social impact now known as The Salah Effect. Translating this research into two different formats required me to develop new technical skills, such as coding language toggles, adding color-blind filters, and organizing complex information into interactive sections. Working on these pieces side by side allowed me to grow both academically and technically, and it taught me how to turn research into usable and accessible digital media.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Phase 4 gave me the opportunity to present my ideas in more than one way. My multimedia presentation allowed me to verbally communicate my research findings, while my interactive kiosk showed that I could design an experience where users guide their own learning through pages on Early Life, Career, Activism, and The Salah Effect. Together, these two formats demonstrated my ability to organize information clearly, adapt content for different audiences, and create a polished final product that effectively communicates even without me standing beside it.</p>
